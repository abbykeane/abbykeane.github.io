  <p>What is something you purposefully do slowly? Most things in life I try to do as fast as possible but letting a good song play keeps your mind present in the moment.  With "Playlist" I wanted to play with type in motion along with few seconds of some iconic pop songs.  Sometimes I time my daily tasks with a specific playlist, so I wanted to refrence that experience along with the theme, "The Time is Now."</p>
