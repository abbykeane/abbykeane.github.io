    Project one is a short animation of an ipod fliiping through several songs.  What is something you try to do slowly? Listening to a good song! The time is now speaks to me about what it means to be present and something that makes me feel present is listening to my playlists.

    little car tvs bc i think it would be nice to watch as you are falling asleep in the car as a wee child listening to music so you can randomly remember these animations like 30 years later

       cars are definitely a real place i'm thinking more of a mini van or suv type deal with three rows and those tiny tvs that pop down from the ceiling. the oly noise is the white noise from the high way,
       its kind of dark and your on a log drive with your parents and they think your asleep but your not really sure what state your in
