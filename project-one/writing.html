    Project one is a short animation <br>of an ipod flipping through several songs.<br>  What is something you try to do slowly? <br>Listening to a good song!<br> The time is now speaks to me about what it means to be present <br>and something that makes me feel present is listening to my playlists.

    <span id="title">little car tvs</span> bc i think it would be nice to watch as you<br>are falling asleep in the car as a wee child<br> listening to music so you can randomly remember these<br> animations like 30 years later
    <ul>
      <li>
       cars are definitely a real place <br>i'm thinking more of a mini van or suv type deal<br> with three rows and those tiny tvs that pop down from the ceiling.<br> the only noise is the white noise from the high way,<br>
       its kind of dark and your on a long drive<br> with your parents and they think your asleep<br> but your not really sure what state your in
